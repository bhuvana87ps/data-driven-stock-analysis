## 📊 KPI Cards (Exact DAX Used)

### 🟦 Total Stocks
**Purpose**: Market breadth

```DAX
Total Stocks = COUNT(stock_prices[ticker])

```DAX
Avg Close Price = AVERAGE(stock_prices[close])
Formatting

Display Units: Thousands (K)

Decimal Places: 2
🟦 Daily Return (Calculated Column)

```DAX
Daily Return =
DIVIDE(
    stock_prices[close] - stock_prices[open],
    stock_prices[open]
)
🟦 Average Daily Return (%)

Purpose: Market performance indicator

```DAX
Avg Daily Return (%) = AVERAGE(stock_prices[Daily Return])
Formatting

Percentage

2 decimal places

🟦 Total Volume

Purpose: Market liquidity

```DAX
Total Volume = SUM(stock_prices[volume])


Formatting

Display Units: Billions (Bn)

🎨 Conditional Logic (Optional)
Market Direction Label

```DAX
Market Color =
IF(
    stock_prices[Daily Return] >= 0,
    "Green",
    "Red"
)


Used for conditional formatting or sentiment cards.
